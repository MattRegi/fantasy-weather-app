# 🐉✨ Fantasy Weather App

A weather app with a twist! This project uses **React** and integrates with the **OpenWeather API**, but unlike typical weather apps, it taps into my nerdy side to create a more unique, immersive experience.

Upon fetching live data from the OpenWeather API, you're greeted with a custom message inspired by a **fantasy or magical world**, based on the current weather. 

For example:  
> *"The Great Dragon's Fire Smiles Upon The Realm Today."*
